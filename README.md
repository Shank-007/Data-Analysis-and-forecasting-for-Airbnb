# Data-Analysis-and-forecasting-for-Airbnb

Airbnb has changed the way the world interacts with the hospitality industry forever. Traditional hotels now have a whole new competitive landscape to consider, and consumers have more exciting choices than ever before. 
All this is thanks to a few friends who started renting an air mattress in their living room 14 years ago. The internet has dramatically shaped the way many businesses operate, and the hospitality industry is no exception.
In the project described below we choose to limit our scope to Airbnbâ€™s property selection, amenities selection, property reservation, and payment processes. 


These tables were populated with data and implemented into a working transactional database. 
We then successfully ran various sample queries to prove that our database was operational and meet the user requirements of the project.

Implemented the analysis and forecasting insights across nationwide properties using Python, Postgres, DBeaver and Tableau for modeling. 
Presented a roadmap for its core business that is designed to bring key benefits all kind of travels and the compatibility of future features with current model to course professor using data-driven insights and functional design documents


In summary, this project has been a success. Airbnb is still a growing company, and this project has provided us with new insight into how they operate. 
As a team we all felt that our learning objectives were met during this project, and we look forward to putting this knowledge to use in our future careers.
